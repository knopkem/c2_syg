# Html5 WebRTC game

This is a Z like strategy game where each player starts with a main base and a few units.
The goal is to destroy the other players main base. 
To build up a strong army the player should 'liberate' neutral factories first which produce light or heavy armored units.

The game can be played with one (Single) or two players (Multi). Multi-player mode requires another player to join the battle.
